## install-php-extensions assets

In order to install PHP extensions, `install-php-extensions` sometime requires to download libraries from internet.

The problem is that some sources have a low availability, so we store them in this `asset` branch.

Those assets are listed in the [`resources`](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/tree/assets/resources) folder.
